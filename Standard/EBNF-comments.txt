Document - A document consists of a collection of (named) OMS, OMS networks, and mappings between these. Alternatively, a Library can be a (possibly structured) NativeDocument.
DOLLibrary - A DOLLibrary consists of a name, followed by a list of LibraryItems. The latter are (named) OMS, OMS networks, and mappings between these.
NativeDocument - The syntax of a NativeDocument is left unspecified. A NativeDocument is a verbatim inclusion of an OMS written in an OMS language that conforms with DOL. The  MOF metaclasses of the abstract syntaxes of any conforming OMS languages are subclasses of the DOL metaclass NativeDocument.
LibraryItem - A LibraryItem is either a definition of an OMS (OMSDefinition), a mapping between OMS (MappingDefinition), a definition of an OMS network (NetworkDefinition), an import of another library (LibraryImport), or a Qualification selecting a specific OMS language, logic and/or syntax that is used to interpret the subsequent LibraryItems.
LibraryImport - Import of another library. All LibraryItems of the imported library are included into the importing one.
Qualification - A Qualification selects a specific OMS language, logic and/or syntax that is used to interpret the subsequent LibraryItems.
LanguageQualification - A LanguageQualification selects a specific OMS language that is used to interpret the subsequent LibraryItems. If no logic has been selected previously or the previously selected logic is not supported by the newly selected language, the language's default logic is used. An analogous rule holds for the serialization.
LogicQualification - A LogicQualification selects a specific logic that is used to interpret the subsequent LibraryItems.
SyntaxQualification - A SyntaxQualification selects a specific serialization (syntax) that is used to interpret the subsequent LibraryItems.
PrefixMap - At the beginning of a library, one can declare a PrefixMap for abbreviating long IRIs using CURIEs.
PrefixBinding - A binding of a prefix to an IRI. The prefix will be used as shorthand for the IRI in CURIEs.
Separators - Both the separator between the library and the OMS name and that between the OMS name and the symbol name can be declared (using Separator), and both default to "//".


NetworkDefinition - A NetworkDefinition names an OMS network.
Network - An OMS network consists of OMS and OMS mappings. OMS networks may build on previously-defined OMS networks, and they can be used in combinations. By convention, all OMS mappings between the involved OMS will be included in the network. However, it is also possible to explicitly exclude OMS mappings from a network.
NetworkElement - One element of a network, which can be an OMS, an OMS mapping, or a network again.
ExcludedElement - Reference to a network element, either given by an IRI, or by a pair of IRIs (source and target), that shall be excluded from a network.
PathReference - Path in a network, to be excluded from the network.

OMS - ontology, specification or model. An OMS can be a native OMS or a DOL structured OMS.

TranslationOMS - Assignment of new names to some non-logical symbols non-logical symbol of an OMS.
ReductionOMS - Restriction of an OMS to a smaller signature.
ExtractionOMS - Extraction of a subOMS that conservatively extends to conservative extension  the whole OMS.

FilteringOMS - verbatim removal of symbols or axioms from an OMS.
UnionOMS - aggregation of several OMS to a new OMS, without any renaming.
ExtensionOMS - OMS whose sets of non-logical symbols non-logical symbol and sentences sentence are supersets of those present in the local environment.
QualifiedOMS - OMS qualified with the OMS language that is used to express it.
CombinationOMS - aggregation of all the OMS in an OMS network, where non-logical symbols are shared according to the OMS mappings in the OMS network.
ApplicationOMS - application of a substitution to an OMS.
Closure - The part of a ClosureOMS on which the closed-world assumption is being applied.

Extraction - Specifies the way how a module shall be extracted from an OMS. Is part of an ExtractionOMS.
Approximation - Specifies the way how an OMS shall be approximated. Is part of an ApproximationOMS.
Filtering - Specifies the way how an OMS shall be filtered. Is part of a FilteringOMS.
Extension - Specifies the way how an OMS shall be extended. Is part of an ExtensionOMS.
ConservativityStrength - Specifies additional relations that may hold between an OMS and its extension, like conservative or definitional extension. The rationale is that the extension should not have impact on the original OMS that is being extended. A ConservativityStrength might also be applied to a single OMS, which is then implicitly regarded as an extension of the empty OMS. In this case, satisfiability (or a similar property) of the OMS is expressed.
RemovalKind - Specifies the kind of extraction, approximation or filtering, namely whether the specified symbols shall be kept ('keep') or removed ('remove').
InterfaceSignature - Signature of symbols that are relevant for the module extraction. (Note: this should become an association.)

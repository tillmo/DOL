heterogeneous logical environment as a number of institutions linked
by institution morphisms and comorphisms.  We discuss heterogeneous
specifications built in such environments, with inter-institutional
specification morphisms based on both institution morphisms and
comorphisms.
We distinguish three kinds of heterogeneity:
(1) specifications in logical environments with universal logic
(2) heterogeneous specifications focused at a particular logic, and
(3) heterogeneous specifications distributed over a number of logics.},

support for Common Logic. This is achieved via logic translations that relate Common Logic and some of its sublogics
to already supported logics and automated theorem proving systems. We thus provide the first theorem proving support
for Common Logic covering the full language, including the possibility of verifying meta-theoretical relationships
between Common Logic theories.},

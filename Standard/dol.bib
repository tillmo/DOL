heterogeneous logical environment as a number of institutions linked
by institution morphisms and comorphisms.  We discuss heterogeneous
specifications built in such environments, with inter-institutional
specification morphisms based on both institution morphisms and
comorphisms.
We distinguish three kinds of heterogeneity:
(1) specifications in logical environments with universal logic
(2) heterogeneous specifications focused at a particular logic, and
(3) heterogeneous specifications distributed over a number of logics.},

heterogeneous logical environment as a number of institutions linked
by institution morphisms and comorphisms.  We discuss heterogeneous
specifications built in such environments, with inter-institutional
specification morphisms based on both institution morphisms and
comorphisms.
We distinguish three kinds of heterogeneity:
(1) specifications in logical environments with universal logic
(2) heterogeneous specifications focused at a particular logic, and
(3) heterogeneous specifications distributed over a number of logics.},

the diverse datasets and ontologies arising in the Semantic Web. We show
that category theory provides the powerful abstractions needed for a uniform
treatment at various levels: semantics, language design, reasoning and tools.
The Distributed Ontology Language DOL is extended in a natural way with
constructs for networks of ontologies. We in particular show how the three
semantics of Zimmermann and Euzenat can be uniformly and faithfully represented using these DOL language constructs. Finally, we summarise how
the DOL alignment features are currently being implemented in the Ontohub/Hets ecosystem, including support for the OWL and Alignment APIs.},
